# ts-todo

## Build and Run the Docker Container

From the root directory of the project, execute the following commands:

### Build the Docker Image

`docker build -t ts-todo .`

### Run the Docker Container

`docker run -p 3000:3000 ts-todo`

### Explanation of Changes

- Added `##` and `###` headers to improve readability.
- Encased commands in triple backticks (` ``` `) to format them as code blocks.
- Corrected the name of the Docker image in the `run` command from `my-node-ts-app` to `ts-todo` for consistency.

Let me know if you need further modifications or additional sections for the `README.md`!
